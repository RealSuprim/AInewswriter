The Gunners may no longer be in pole position to sign the Sporting striker
By Alex Young
The striker is expected to leave Portugal this summer and is at the centre of a transfer
tug-of-war between the two Premier League giants.
It was reported earlier in June that Gyokeres had "officially" rejected United and a reunion
with former Sporting head coach Ruben Amorim following Arsenal making their interest
clear.
Portuguese outlet Record claimed that United have been made aware of Gyokeres'
decision to snub a move to Old Trafford after talks with the player's agents.

But The Mirror now claim that United are back in the frame, and seen by some as the
most likely destination for Gyokeres despite being unable to offer Champions League
football.

Arsenal are currently wrapping up deals for Christian Norgaard and Kepa Arrizabalaga,
for a combined Â£15million, and are expected to step up moves for a striker next week
after the PSR deadline passes on June 30.
The Gunners are said by some to favour Sesko, who could also prove a cheaper option
with Sporting digging in their heels over an asking price for Gyokeres.
That has reportedly led Gyokeres to reassess other options, of which United is the most
prominent.
The Mirror report that intermediaries have made contact on the player's behalf to inform
United of his change of heart and that is ready to move to Old Trafford.
