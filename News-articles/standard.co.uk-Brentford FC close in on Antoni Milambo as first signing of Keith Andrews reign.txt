The highly rated Dutch youngster comes with a big reputation
By Dom Smith
Standard Sport understands negotiations have been ongoing since April and the Bees
are confident of landing the highly-rated 20-year-old.
Milambo, who graduated through Feyenoord's academy, can play as a central midfielder
or attacking midfielder and was a key player for the side that finished third in the Dutch
Eredivisie this season.
Brentford have already seen their manager, Thomas Frank, depart after he succeeded
Ange Postecoglou at Tottenham. He will be replaced by set-piece coach Keith Andrews in
his first head coach role.
If the club move decisively to complete a deal for Milambo, the Dutch youth international
will become the first signing of Andrews’s reign.
Milambo, who scored three times in the Champions League last season, was this week
part of the Netherlands squad who were knocked out of the Under-21 European
Championships semi-finals by Lee Carsley’s England.
